# AxeBC2 Core 31 DEV release gates

The DEV recipe maps store ID `willitmod-dev-bc2` to canonical 5tratumOS app ID
`axebc2`. Its preserved data path is `/var/lib/5tratumos/apps/axebc2`, matching
the `app_id` in `.5tratumos-rollback-policy.json`.

Every host bind uses `create_host_path: false`. The recipe contains the empty
runtime directories that 5tratumOS stages before Compose validation, so Docker
must not silently create a misspelled or missing source path.

The digest-pinned generic Alpine init container installs `jq` and
`gettext-envsubst` from Alpine 3.22 repositories at startup. This remains a
network-availability dependency, but an install failure occurs before any
persistent app-data or node-data mutation and prevents Core from starting. A
future dedicated, independently built and digest-pinned init image could remove
that availability dependency; it is not introduced in this consensus release.

The committed Compose file is finalized: it contains one immutable application
sha256 pin and two identical immutable Core sha256 pins, with no digest
sentinels. CI detects this as the strict `finalized` phase. The earlier
`prefinalization` phase accepted exactly one `APP_CANDIDATE_DIGEST_REQUIRED` and
two `CORE31_CANDIDATE_DIGEST_REQUIRED` occurrences; a partial or mixed state is
rejected in either phase.

Finalization replaced those sentinels with the exact verified
multi-architecture candidate digests. The merged platform Compose must pass
validation, all images must pull anonymously by digest, init must complete
successfully on 5tratumOS 0.7.12+, and the resulting installation must be
tested on DEV before any production promotion.

Run `scripts/finalize-axebc2-0.1.10-dev.sh` with the exact application index
digest, exact Core candidate tag and exact Core index digest. The application
candidate is fixed to `0.1.10-candidate.6e4ef58218e8` from source revision
`6e4ef58218e8cd5a4d1113196f9872a7f501f52e`. The Core candidate is fixed to
`31.1.0-rc.cdf44542dde2` from source revision
`cdf44542dde255648008249d187fafc15f3a2f09`, candidate workflow run
`33675068951`. Before editing Compose, the
finalizer anonymously verifies candidate resolution, amd64 and arm64 manifests
and pulls. It atomically replaces every sentinel and emits both exact source
revisions in the evidence JSON template, which must be completed only after
live DEV acceptance.

The test platform is also fixed to the published DEV-only
[`v0.7.12-dev`](https://github.com/WillItMod/5tratum/releases/tag/v0.7.12-dev)
bundle with SHA-256
`11a35e68ab169eb0446485992a57b33fae018a92020b7d86bbf9a005571377af`.
The finalizer writes that exact value into the acceptance template; it is not a
free-form observation. MAIN promotion rejects evidence from a different OS
bundle even when the displayed version string is the same.

The store validator exercises a pinned copy of the relevant 5tratumOS
materialization contract from platform commit `4f979cb9541622c1fdccdf43b8a885bbf845ba38`:
it consumes `app_proxy`, publishes the manifest port on the resolved app
service, removes the legacy shared network, and normalizes restart policies.
The platform currently exposes this logic only inside its mutating install and
update commands, so invoking the live implementation from isolated store CI
would require performing a stateful platform transaction. Final DEV acceptance
therefore still runs the real platform materializer and validates its generated
Compose file before containers are started.

## Live DEV acceptance

The exact finalized candidate was accepted on `10.10.10.235` using the pinned
5tratumOS `v0.7.12-dev` bundle on 2026-09-04. The mandatory Core 31 full reindex
completed, its protected migration markers validated, and a subsequent full app
restart did not repeat the reindex. Core reported version `310100`, completed a
level-4 `verifychain`, and matched the official BitcoinII explorer at height
58,433 and block hash
`0000000000000001077a5ea39eefb3a44e5d88357c723f56484840a7f89c5554`.

Five outbound BitcoinII Core 31 peers were observed. Six historical one-block
header branches ended between heights 53,093 and 53,209, all before the
ShockWave checkpoint; no non-active valid tip existed at or beyond checkpoint
height 57,752, so the recorded number of competing valid tips is zero.

The non-submitting Stratum probe received subscribe, authorize, difficulty and
job notifications. The configured payout was compared using a private HMAC and
remained unchanged. The UI/privacy checks, telemetry and port-exposure checks,
post-completion restart, app rollback rejection and OS rollback rejection all
passed. All 39 unrelated application containers retained their preflight image
and container identifiers.
